My life story in 100 words

I was born and raised in Hagen, Germany. I loved school and grew up playing team Handball.
I went to study Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, then at UCONN. Bringing only one suitcase and a backpack, I moved to the US to earn a Ph.D. at Yale. Since graduating, I have worked in Data Science and Machine Learning across various industries - Fintech, Adtech, Fashion. Currently, I am at Spotify. After over 10 years in the US, I moved back to Germany. One suitcase and a backpack had turned into a small house full of stuff, a wife, and a dog.
