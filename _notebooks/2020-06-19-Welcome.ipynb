    "Putting my writing in public is frightening. Not because it's precious to me, but because it does not exist yet. But communicating my intention to blog puts me on the hook to actually deliver something. Now the pressure starts building. I shouldn't overthink it, though. I am in control. I can shut this thing down in a second, so nothing to worry about.\n",

    "Many people I look up to have blogs. [Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/), [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/), and [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) all practice blogging for their own good reasons. There are common themes among their reasons for blogging.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You blog for yourself and use writing as a thinking tool.\n",
    "2. You add value to others by sharing what you spent time learning and digesting, so you can save them time. \n",
    "3. You build an audience and get them thinking about topics and causes you find valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "My intention with this blog to capture some of my technical learnings, teachings, and potentially a stream of conciousness. I do not know how frequently I will post or how deeply I will explore certain topics, but I believe it can serve me as a tool to clarify my own thinking, and improve my writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hope is that others, like you, find some portion of this blog useful. Only time will tell if there is any value in this for me or you, so I am not making any big promises. \n",
